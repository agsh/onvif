# ONVIF

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/agsh/onvif.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/agsh/onvif?branch=master)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/onvif.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onvif)

ONVIF Client protocol Profile S (Live Streaming) and Profile G (Replay) Node.js implementation.

This is a wrapper to ONVIF protocol which allows you to get information about your NVT (network video transmitter)
device, its media sources, control PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) movements and manage presets, detect devices in your network and control its events.
It will also allow you to get information about your NVR (network video recorder) Profile G device and obtain a list of recordings.

The library uses NodeJS. And works on the server-side.

[![ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org/wp-content/themes/onvif-public/images/logo.png)](http://onvif.org)

## Troubleshooting
The library is tested on a test bed with 5 x Axis, 2 x Bosch, 1 x Canon, 2 x Hanwha, 4 x HikVision, 1 x Panasonic, 2 x Sony and 2 x unknown vendor cameras. There is a mix of PTZ and Fixed cameras and a mix of Pre-Profile, Profile S, Profile G and Profile T devices.

It is also tested with some Analogue Encoders from Avigilon, Axis, Bosch and HikVision including testing the RS485 output.

We welcome any donations or long term loans cameras from other vendors to test compatibility especially when testing the Media2 API, ONVIF Events and OSD.


## Installation

### NPM

`npm install onvif` - install latest stable version

`npm install agsh/onvif` - install latest version from GitHub

`npm install agsh/onvif#v1` - install latest development version

### Clone the latest version from github
`git clone https://github.com/agsh/onvif.git`

### Tests
In the library directory run `npm test`

By default the tests use a mockup server to generate ONVIF replies.

To test with the real device, set appropriate environment variables `HOSTNAME`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `PORT` and run
tests.

### Documentation
To build jsdoc for the library with default theme run `npm run jsdoc`. Otherwise use `jsdoc` with sources from
`./lib/*.js`

## Quick example

Special teasing example how to create little funny video server (http://localhost:6147) with 1 ffmpeg and 3 node.js libraries:
<video src="https://github.com/agsh/onvif/assets/576263/e816fed6-067a-4f77-b3f5-ccd9d5ff1310" width="300" />

```shell
sudo apt install ffmpeg
npm install onvif socket.io rtsp-ffmpeg
```

```js
const server = require('http').createServer((req, res) =>
        res.end(`
<!DOCTYPE html><body>
<canvas width='640' height='480' />
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script><script>
  const socket = io(), ctx = document.getElementsByTagName('canvas')[0].getContext('2d');
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    const img = new Image;    
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([new Uint8Array(data)], {type: 'application/octet-binary'}));
    img.onload = () => {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url, {type: 'application/octet-binary'});
      ctx.drawImage(img, 100, 100);
    };
    img.src = url;
  });
</script></body></html>`));
const { Cam } = require('onvif/promises'), io = require('socket.io')(server), rtsp = require('rtsp-ffmpeg');
server.listen(6147);

const cam = new Cam({username: 'username', password: 'password', hostname: '192.168.0.116', port: 2020});
(async() => {
  await cam.connect();
  const input = (await cam.getStreamUri({protocol:'RTSP'})).uri.replace('://', `://${cam.username}:${cam.password}@`);
  const stream = new rtsp.FFMpeg({input, resolution: '320x240', quality: 3});
  io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    const pipeStream = socket.emit.bind(socket, 'data');
    stream.on('disconnect', () => stream.removeListener('data', pipeStream)).on('data', pipeStream);
  });
  setInterval(() => cam.absoluteMove({
    x: Math.random() * 2 - 1,
    y: Math.random() * 2 - 1,
    zoom: Math.random()
  }), 3000);
})().catch(console.error);
```

## Other examples (located in the Examples Folder on the Github)
* [example.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example.js) - Move camera to a pre-defined position then server the RTSP URL up via a HTTP Server. Click on the RTSP address in a browser to open the video (if you have the VLC plugin installed)
* [example2.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example2.js) - takes an IP address range, scans the range for ONVIF devices (brute force scan) and displays information about each device found including make and model and RTSP URLs
For Profile S Cameras and Encoders it displays the default RTSP address
For Profile G Recorders it displays the RTSP address of the first recording
* [example3.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example3.js) - reads the command line cursor keys and sends PTZ commands to the Camera
* [example4.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example4.js) - uses Discovery to find cameras on the local network 
* [example5.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example5.js) - connect to a camera via  SOCKS proxy. Note SSH includes a SOCKS proxy so you can use this example to connect to remote cameras via SSH
* [example6.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example6.js) - ONVIF Events. Example can be switched btween using Pull Point Subscriptions and using Base Subscribe with a built in mini HTTP Server
* [example7.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example7.js) - example using a Promise API. It uses 'promisify' to convert the ONVIF Library to return promises and uses Await to wait for responses
* [example8.js](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/master/examples/example8.js) - example setting OSD On Screen Display. (also uses Promises API)

# API

## You can find this page and full API class documentation here: [https://onvif.pages.dev/](https://onvif.pages.dev/) ##

Short description of library possibilities is below.

## Discovery

Since 0.2.7 version library supports WS-Discovery of NVT devices. Currently it uses only `Probe` SOAP method that just works well.
You can find devices in your subnetwork using `probe` method of the Discovery singleton.
Discovery is an EventEmitter inheritor, so you can wait until discovery timeout, or subscribe on `device` event.
You must subscribe to the `error` event as a device on your network could reply with bad XML
Here some examples:

```js
var onvif = require('onvif');
onvif.Discovery.on('device', function(cam){
// function will be called as soon as NVT responds
	cam.username = <USERNAME>;
	cam.password = <PASSWORD>;
	cam.connect(console.log);
})
// Must have an error handler to catch bad replies from the network
onvif.Discovery.on('error', function (err,xml) {
  // function called as soon as NVT responds, but this library could not parse the response
  console.log('Discovery error ' + err);
});
onvif.Discovery.probe();
```

```js
var onvif = require('onvif');
// Must have an error handler to catch bad replies from the network
onvif.Discovery.on('error', function (err,xml) {
  console.log('Discovery error ' + err);
});
onvif.Discovery.probe(function(err, cams) {
// function will be called only after timeout (5 sec by default)
	if (err) { 
    // There is a device on the network returning bad discovery data
    // Probe results will be incomplete
    throw err;
  }
	cams.forEach(function(cam) {
		cam.username = <USERNAME>;
		cam.password = <PASSWORD>;
		cam.connect(console.log);
	});
});
```

In all of that cases you've got disconnected cameras. To access each camera (and issue ONVIF commands) you normally need
the tuple `username:password`. So, as shown in the examples, you can assign these properties and call `connect` method to
get full functionality.

### Discovery.probe(options, callback)
Options

- `timeout`, number. Time the probe method will wait NVT responses in ms
- `resolve`, boolean. If this argument is false, all discovered NVTs would be presented as data object instead of Cam instance

### Discovery events
- `device(cam, remoteInfo, responseXML)` fires on device discover. `cam` is a Cam instance, remoteInfo is an object with network information
 and responseXML is a body of SOAP response
- `error(error)` fires on some UDP error or on bad SOAP response from NVT

## Promises

Since version 0.7.2 this library have a `onvif/promises` namespace. It have promisified version of Cam constructor which returns an object with 
the same methods as described below or in documentation but returns promises instead of callback function. Short example of common 
usage is here:

```js
const onvif = require('onvif/promises');
onvif.Discovery.on('device', async (cam) => {
  // Set credentials to connect
  cam.username = 'username';
  cam.password = 'password';
  await cam.connect();
  cam.on('event', (event)=> console.log(JSON.stringify(event.message, null, '\t')));
  cam.on('eventsError', console.error);
  console.log(cam.username, cam.password);
  console.log((await cam.getStreamUri({protocol:'RTSP'})).uri);
  const date = await cam.getSystemDateAndTime();
  console.log(date);
  await cam.absoluteMove({
    x: Math.random() * 2 - 1,
    y: Math.random() * 2 - 1,
    zoom: Math.random()
  });
});
onvif.Discovery.on('error', console.error);
onvif.Discovery.probe();
```

## Cam class

```javascript
const Cam = require('onvif').Cam;
```

## new Cam(options, callback)

Options are:
- hostname
- username, password (optional, to deal with majority of functions)
- port (optional)

The library calls connect() automatically which executes the `getSystemDateAndTime`, `getCapabilities` and other methods.
Note on username and password:
- Some cameras do not require username:password credentials.
- If a camera does require a username:password but you do not provide them, you will be limited to executing a few ONVIF methods that can operate without credentials, for example you can execute only `getSystemDateAndTime` method.

Callback (optional) executes when the cam is initialised. Single argument for this function is possible error.

#### Technical description

When the cam object is created it automatically sends a `getCapabilities` command to the ONVIF device. If the device is a camera or encoder (NVT) it sends two commands to the ONVIF device:
`getVideoSources` and `getProfiles`. It fills corresponding properties of an object:

+ capabilities
  - device
  - events
  - imaging
  - media
  - PTZ
  - extension
+ uri (this is a links to different NVT services)
+ videoSources
  - $.token
  - framerate
  - resolution
+ profiles, array of profile object
  - name
  - videoSourceConfiguration
  - videoEncoderConfiguration
  - PTZConfiguration

After that it runs `getActiveSources` method. It iterates over all video sources and tries to find out proper configuration
for profile and videosource. First matching profile becomes a member of defaultProfiles array and video source configuration
with ptz configuration becomes a member of activeSources array.

Configuration for the first or the only one video source becomes defaultProfile and activeSource properties. All methods
without passing options object use it. You can change it manually at any time.

+ defaultProfile (link to the first profile in profiles)
+ activeSource (based on the default profile)
  - sourceToken
  - profileToken
  - encoding
  - width
  - height
  - fps
  - bitrate
  - ptz

### connect(callback)
Connect to the camera and fill device information properties with `getSystemDateAndTime`, `getCapabilities`, `getVideoSources`, `getProfiles` methods

See more detailed information at http://www.onvif.org/ver10/media/wsdl/media.wsdl
After cam initialisation we can run several ONVIF commands.
There are several common methods that work without credentials. Here are they: `getSystemDateAndTime`.

### getSystemDateAndTime(callback)
Returns a Date object with current camera datetime in the callback.
The ONVIF Standard says this would work without credentials (passed `username` and `password` arguments) so that the timeShift difference between the local clock and the NVT's onboard clock can be calculated for SOAP Authentication. However some devices claiming ONVIF support require a password and the library will re-try the connection if a username and password are available.

### getDeviceInformation(callback)
*Device.* Returns a device information, such as manufacturer, model and firmware version in the callback

### getServices(callback)
*Device.* Returns in callback and assigns to `#services` property an array consists of objects with properties: `namespace`, `XAddr`, `version`

### getServiceCapabilities(callback)
*Device.* Returns in callback and assigns to `#serviceCapabilities` property the capabilities of the device service (not media):
network, security and system. If your device supports some auxiliary capabilities they will be there too.

The options are:

* `profileToken` (optional) - defines media profile to use and will define the configuration of the content of the stream. Default is `#activeSource.profileToken`
* `presetName` - the name to give to the preset. (optional) is this is a preset update.

### removePreset(options, callback)
*PTZ.* Operation to remove a preset specified by the preset token. After success, you should re-fetch the presets with `#getPresets` method.

### gotoHomePosition(options, callback)
*PTZ.* Operation to go to the saved `home` position for the PTZ node in the selected profile. If no `home` position has been saved, the ONVIF camera will do nothing.

The options are:

* `profileToken` (optional) - defines media profile to use and will define the configuration of the content of the stream. Default is `#activeSource.profileToken`
