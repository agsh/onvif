# ONVIF

[![Coverage Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agsh/onvif/refs/heads/gh-pages-debug/badges/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/tree/v1)

ONVIF Client protocol Node.js implementation.

> [!TIP]
> This is unstable branch for version 1.x, for stable use version 0.x see [branch v0.x](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/tree/v0.x)

This is a wrapper to ONVIF protocol which allows you to get information about your NVT (network video transmitter)
device, its media sources, control PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) movements and manage presets, detect devices in your network and 
control its events. It will also allow you to get information about your NVR (network video recorder) Profile G device 
and obtain a list of recordings.

The library uses Node.js. And works on the server-side.

This is a new version of the ONVIF library. Previous version was written in JS, and this the typescript library with 
interfaces descbring ONVIF data structures. Right now some of the methods from the v.0.8 were implemented, 
the list of supported ONVIF commands you can find here: https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/CHECKED.md 

The library will be updated because other methods are currently under development.

The documentation for the new library was generated by typedoc and you can find it here: 
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/docs/index.html

The code, which use the old version of the library (0.8.x), should work using the compatibility class: 
https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/src/compatibility/cam.ts where all methods are located. (Currently unsupported)

Thanks a lot for your interest and I will be glad to any questions and comments!

### Interfaces
Interfaces are generated according to the latest version of the [ONVIF specification](https://github.com/onvif/specs).

All methods accepts options from the ONVIF specs and returns data inside the `<method_name>Response`. For example, 
method `getCapabilities` accepts one argument with the type `GetCapabilities` and returns result with the type
`Capabilities` This is the inner structure of the GetCapabilitiesResponse type:
```ts
export interface GetCapabilitiesResponse {
  /** Capability information. */
  capabilities?: Capabilities;
}
class Device {
  // ...
  async getCapabilities(options?: GetCapabilities): Promise<Capabilities> {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```
Of course, there are exceptions everywhere, the main rule is to try not to return an object with one property.

In some cases, where it is more convenient to use native js types, interfaces are extended by adding new fields that 
are more convenient to work with. A keyword is used at the end of the names, for example `SetSystemDateAndTime` becomes
`SetSystemDateAndTimeExtended` with `dateTime?: Date;` field.

### `xs:any` support

The ONVIF specifications include numerous extension points, which presents a challenge: on one hand, we aim to use simple 
and convenient methods and interfaces; on the other hand, we need a unified mechanism to handle a large volume of 
undocumented data provided via `<xs:any namespace="##any" processContents="lax" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>` tags 
in vendor-specific APIs.

This is particularly important for ensuring backward and forward compatibility, as well as for enabling transformation 
between XML and JavaScript objects in ONVIF get/set methods.

Letâ€™s take a closer look at a specific case. Suppose we have an `ElementItem` structure with predefined attributes and 
elements, as described in 
[onvif.xsd](https://github.com/onvif/specs/blob/9cdc78685cc9ddd80099a7a9cb9ada035dd0d5eb/wsdl/ver10/schema/onvif.xsd#L6611), 
along with additional, unknown elements (note that `xs:anyAttribute` is currently unsupported) returned by the device:
```xml
<xs:element name="ElementItem" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
    <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation>Complex value structure.</xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
    <xs:complexType>
        <xs:sequence>
            <xs:any namespace="##any" processContents="lax">
                <xs:annotation>
                    <xs:documentation>XML tree containing the element value as defined in the corresponding description.</xs:documentation>
                </xs:annotation>
            </xs:any>
        </xs:sequence>
        <xs:attribute name="Name" type="xs:string" use="required">
            <xs:annotation>
                <xs:documentation>Item name.</xs:documentation>
            </xs:annotation>
        </xs:attribute>
    </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```
This structure turns into this autogenerated interface in typescript (`src/interfaces` directory)
```ts
export interface ElementItem {
  /** Item name. */
  name: string;
  /** XML tree containing the element value as defined in the corresponding description. */
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```
In real cases, for example in `MetadataConfiguration` the XML will be look like
```xml
<Parameters>
    <ElementItem>
        <Name>elementItem1</Name>
        <Param1>
            <Data>42</Data>
        </Param1>
        <Param2>param2</Param2>
    </ElementItem>
</Parameters>
```
When you want to get the data in the `getMetadataConifugation` request it becomes a little bit strange object, but it's ok
```js
{
  elementItem : [{
    name    : 'elementItem1',
    param1  : { data : 42 },
    param2  : 'param2',
    __any__ : {
      'Name'   : ['elementItem1'],
      'Param1' : [{
        'Data' : ['42']
      }],
      'Param2' : 'param2'
    }
  }]
}
```
Here we have required `name` field in the element item. Also parsed unknown for the schema `xs:any` fields: `param1` and
`param2`. And strange `__any__` field. In fact this is just unprocessed item from the 
[xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js).

A reasonable question: why? Why do we have this here? The answer is simple. When we need to manipulate with the device
and setup different extensions, parameters, etc. we don't event know how to serialize the pretty js-object to a
ugly xml-structure. But we want to work with the data easily and comfortable. So, when we want to change something in
the ONVIF device, in this example it is a `setMetadataConfiguration` method, we just need to follow two simple rules:
* change known fields as is: `elementItem[0].name = 'hello'`
* change anything we don't know about in the specification in the `__all__` field `elementItem[0].__any__.Param2 = 'hi'`
And this structure will be easy picked up and converted into the appropriate SOAP XML!

### Tests
All tests are written using Jest. You can run them with `npm test`.
The tests use [happytime-onvif-server](https://github.com/agsh/happytime-onvif-server) as a test device.
