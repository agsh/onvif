# ONVIF

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/agsh/onvif.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/agsh/onvif?branch=master)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/onvif.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onvif)

ONVIF Client protocol Profile S (Live Streaming) and Profile G (Replay) Node.js implementation.

This is a wrapper to ONVIF protocol which allows you to get information about your NVT (network video transmitter)
device, its media sources, control PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) movements and manage presets, detect devices in your network and control its events.
It will also allow you to get information about your NVR (network video recorder) Profile G device and obtain a list of recordings.

The library uses NodeJS. And works on the server-side.

This is a new version of the ONVIF library. Previous version was written in JS, and this the typescript library with 
interfaces descbring ONVIF data structures. Right now some of the methods from the v.0.7.x were implemented, 
the list of supportrted ONVIF commands you can find here: https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/IMPLEMENTED.md 

The library will be updated because other methods are currently under development.

The documentation for the new library was generated by typedoc and you can find it here: 
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/docs/index.html

The code, which use the old version of the library (0.8.x), should work using the compatibility class: 
https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/src/compatibility/cam.ts where all methods are located. (Currently unsupported)

Thanks a lot for your interest and I will be glad to any questions and comments!

P.S. I still need device access to test the code, any help would be greatly appreciated.

### Interfaces
Interfaces are generated according to the latest version of the [ONVIF specification](https://github.com/onvif/specs).

All methods accepts options from the ONVIF specs and returns data inside the `<method_name>Response`. For example, 
method `getCapabilities` accepts one argument with the type `GetCapabilities` and returns result with the type
`Capabilities` This is the inner structure of the GetCapabilitiesResponse type:
```ts
export interface GetCapabilitiesResponse {
  /** Capability information. */
  capabilities?: Capabilities;
}
class Device {
  // ...
  async getCapabilities(options?: GetCapabilities): Promise<Capabilities> {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```
Of course, there are exceptions everywhere, the main rule is to try not to return an object with one property.

In some cases, where it is more convenient to use native js types, interfaces are extended by adding new fields that 
are more convenient to work with. A keyword is used at the end of the names, for example `SetSystemDateAndTime` becomes
`SetSystemDateAndTimeExtended` with `dateTime?: Date;` field.
