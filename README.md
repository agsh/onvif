# ts-onvif
Temporary repo for NPM testing.

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/onvif.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onvif)
[![Coverage Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agsh/onvif/refs/heads/gh-pages-debug/badges/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/agsh/onvif/tree/v1)

ONVIF Client protocol Profile S (Live Streaming) and Profile G (Replay) Node.js implementation.

This is a wrapper to ONVIF protocol which allows you to get information about your NVT (network video transmitter)
device, its media sources, control PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) movements and manage presets, detect devices in your network and 
control its events. It will also allow you to get information about your NVR (network video recorder) Profile G device 
and obtain a list of recordings.

The library uses Node.js. And works on the server-side.

This is a new version of the ONVIF library. Previous version was written in JS, and this the typescript library with 
interfaces descbring ONVIF data structures. Right now some of the methods from the v.0.8 were implemented, 
the list of supported ONVIF commands you can find here: https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/CHECKED.md 

The library will be updated because other methods are currently under development.

The documentation for the new library was generated by typedoc and you can find it here: 
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/docs/index.html

The code, which use the old version of the library (0.8.x), should work using the compatibility class: 
https://github.com/agsh/onvif/blob/v1/src/compatibility/cam.ts where all methods are located. (Currently unsupported)

Thanks a lot for your interest and I will be glad to any questions and comments!

### Interfaces
Interfaces are generated according to the latest version of the [ONVIF specification](https://github.com/onvif/specs).

All methods accepts options from the ONVIF specs and returns data inside the `<method_name>Response`. For example, 
method `getCapabilities` accepts one argument with the type `GetCapabilities` and returns result with the type
`Capabilities` This is the inner structure of the GetCapabilitiesResponse type:
```ts
export interface GetCapabilitiesResponse {
  /** Capability information. */
  capabilities?: Capabilities;
}
class Device {
  // ...
  async getCapabilities(options?: GetCapabilities): Promise<Capabilities> {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```
Of course, there are exceptions everywhere, the main rule is to try not to return an object with one property.

In some cases, where it is more convenient to use native js types, interfaces are extended by adding new fields that 
are more convenient to work with. A keyword is used at the end of the names, for example `SetSystemDateAndTime` becomes
`SetSystemDateAndTimeExtended` with `dateTime?: Date;` field.

### `xs:any` support

The ONVIF specifications include numerous extension points, which presents a challenge: on one hand, we aim to use simple 
and convenient methods and interfaces; on the other hand, we need a unified mechanism to handle a large volume of 
undocumented data provided via `<xs:any namespace="##any" processContents="lax" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>` tags 
in vendor-specific APIs.

This is particularly important for ensuring backward and forward compatibility, as well as for enabling transformation 
between XML and JavaScript objects in ONVIF get/set methods.

Letâ€™s take a closer look at a specific case. Suppose we have an `ElementItem` structure with predefined attributes and 
elements, as described in 
[onvif.xsd](https://github.com/onvif/specs/blob/9cdc78685cc9ddd80099a7a9cb9ada035dd0d5eb/wsdl/ver10/schema/onvif.xsd#L6611), 
along with additional, unknown elements (note that `xs:anyAttribute` is currently unsupported) returned by the device:
```xml
<xs:element name="ElementItem" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
    <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation>Complex value structure.</xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
    <xs:complexType>
        <xs:sequence>
            <xs:any namespace="##any" processContents="lax">
                <xs:annotation>
                    <xs:documentation>XML tree containing the element value as defined in the corresponding description.</xs:documentation>
                </xs:annotation>
            </xs:any>
        </xs:sequence>
        <xs:attribute name="Name" type="xs:string" use="required">
            <xs:annotation>
                <xs:documentation>Item name.</xs:documentation>
            </xs:annotation>
        </xs:attribute>
    </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```

... TODO a lot of explanations how it works and describe future improvements

### Tests
All tests are written using Jest. You can run them with `npm test`.
The tests use [happytime-onvif-server](https://github.com/agsh/happytime-onvif-server) as a test device. 

Thanks to [HappyTimeSoft](https://www.happytimesoft.com/index.html) company for the opportunity to test full ONVIF 
specification. You can download and purchase their products here: https://www.happytimesoft.com/product.html
